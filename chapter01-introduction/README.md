# Summary

1.	Computers execute very basic operations in rapid succession.
2.	Different tasks require different programs.
3.	Programmers produce computer programs to make the computer solve new tasks.
4.	The central processing unit (CPU) executes one operation at a time. 
5. Data values can be brought into the CPU for processing from storage or from input devices such as the keyboard, the mouse, or a communications link. 
6.	Storage devices include random-access memory (RAM) and secondary storage.  
7.	Computer programs are stored as machine instructions in a code that depends on the processor type.
8.	Higher-level languages are independent of the processor.
9.	Programming languages are designed by computer scientists for a variety of purposes.
10. C++ is a general-purpose language that is in widespread use for systems and embedded programming.
11.	Set aside some time to become familiar with the computer system and the C++ compiler that you will use for your class work.
12. Develop a strategy for keeping backup copies of your work before disaster strikes.
13. Every C++ program contains #include directives, to access necessary features such as input and output, and a function called main.
14.	In a simple program, main just displays a message on the screen and then returns with a success indicator.
15. Syntax errors are faulty constructs that do not conform to the rules of the pro- gramming language.
16. Logic errors are constructs that can be translated into a running program, but the resulting program does not perform the intended action.
17.	The programmer is responsible for inspecting and testing the program to guard against logic errors.
18.	C++ programs are translated by a program called a compiler into machine code. 19. A program called a linker combines machine code with previously translated
machine code for input/output and other services to build your program.
20. An algorithm is a description of steps to solve a problem that is unambiguous, executable, and terminating.
