# Summary

1.	Use a vector to collect multiple values of the same type.
2.	Individual values in a vector are accessed by an integer index or subscript: v[i].
3.	Valid values for the index range from 0 to one less than the size of the array.
4.	A bounds error, which occurs if you supply an invalid index to a vector, can have serious consequences.
5.	Use the size function to obtain the current size of a vector. 
6.	Use the push_back member function to add more elements to a vector. Use
pop_back to reduce the size. 
7.	Vectors can occur as the function parameters and return values.
8.	Avoid parallel vectors by changing them into vectors of objects. 
9.	Like vectors, arrays collect elements of the same type. Once the size of an array
has been set, it cannot be changed. 
10. Array parameters are always passed by reference. 
11.	The return type of a function cannot be an array. 
12. Character arrays are arrays of values of the character type char. 
13. Use a two-dimensional array to store tabular data.
14. Individual elements in a two-dimensional array are accessed by double sub- scripts m[i][j].
