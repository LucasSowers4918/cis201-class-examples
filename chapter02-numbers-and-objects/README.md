# Goals 
- To understand the properties and limitations of integer and floating-point numbers
- To write arithmetic expressions and assignment statements in C++
- To appreciate the importance of comments and good code layout
- To be able to define and initialize variables and constants
- To learn how to read user input and display program output
- To use the standard C++ string type to define and manipulate character strings
- To become familiar with using objects and invoking member functions

# Summary
1.	The most common number types in C++ are double (floating-point number) and int (integer).
2.	A variable is a storage location with a name. In C++, you also specify the type of the values that can be stored.
3.	Use the >> operator to read a value from an input stream and place it in a variable.
4.	An assignment statement stores a new value in a variable, replacing the previ- ously stored value.
5.	The ++ operator adds 1 to a variable; the -- operator subtracts 1. 
6.	A constant is a named value that cannot be changed.
7.	In C++, you use * for multiplication and / for division. 
8.	If both arguments of / are integers, the remainder is discarded. The % operator
computes the remainder of an integer division. 
9.	The C++ library defines many mathematical functions such as sqrt (square
root) and pow (raising to a power).
10. Strings are sequences of characters.
11.	A member function is invoked on an object, using the dot notation.
12. The length member function yields the number of characters in a string.
13. Use the substr member function to extract a substring of a string.
14. Use the + operator to concatenate strings; that is, put them together to yield a longer string.
15. An object is a value that can be manipulated without knowledge of its internal structure.
16. Every object belongs to a class. A class determines the behavior of its objects. 
17.	The act of creating an object is called construction. To specify the initial state of an object, you supply construction parameters.
18.	When defining an object with default construction, you do not supply any con- struction parameters.
19. Points, lines, circles, and messages can be displayed in a window on the com- puter screen.
20. When writing programs that display data sets, you should select a coordinate system that fits the data points.
21. Graphical programs can obtain both text and mouse input from the user.
